## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to follow along with the tutorial series and create a 3D scene step by step. Each lesson focuses on different aspects of Blender, such as modelling, texturing, lighting, and rendering.

## Progress Tracking

Throughout the project, intermediate results for each lesson are saved in separate files (the files are named `Donut_{X}.blend`, where `{X}` represents the lesson number). These files allow for easy tracking of progress and provide a way to review the steps taken in each lesson.

The final frames for the video with completed 3D scene and [the rendered video](./Frames/video.mp4) itself can be found in the [`Frames`](./Frames/) folder.

## Assets

Throughout the tutorial, I've used high quality models and materials from [Poliigon](https://www.poliigon.com/) to enhance the visual fidelity of my renders (check folders [`GlasswareWhiskeySet002`](./GlasswareWhiskeySet002/), [`PlantAgave002`](./PlantAgave002/), [`QuartziteDenali002`](./QuartziteDenali002/)).

## Software Used

- Blender 4.0

## Acknowledgments

I'd like to thank Blender Guru and Poliigon for their excellent resources, which were instrumental in this learning adventure.
